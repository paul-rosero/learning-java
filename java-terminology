Java Development Kit(JDK) - 
    Contains Java Runtime Environment (JRE) along various development tools like Java libraries, Java source compilers, Java debuggers, bundling and development tools.

Java Runtime Environment(JRE) - 
    A part od JDK but can be used independently to run any byte code (compiled Java program). It can be called as JVM implementation.

Java Virtual Machine(JVM) - 
    A software that can be ported to various hardware platforms. JVM will become an instace of JRE at runtime of java program. Byte codes are maching language for the JVM. 

Java Application Programming Interface(API)-
    Set of classes' written using Java programming language which runs on JVM. These classes will help prgorammers by providing standard methods like reading from the console, writing to the console, saving objects in data structure etc. 

Java Modifier -
    They are keywords that you add to those definitions to change, modify or specify their meanings. There are 2 tyes: Access and Non-Access.

Java Access Modifiers -
    Keyword to set access levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. There are 4 Levels. 
    Default( no word before the class, variable, method and constructors) -
        Any class, field(variable), method or constructor that has no declared access modifier is accessible only by classes in the same package.
    Private -
        Visible to the class only.
    Public -
        Visible to any class in the Java Program, whether these classes are in the same package or in another package.
    Protected -
        Visible to the package and all subclasses.

Java Non-Access Modifiers -
    Keyword to provide additional functionalities to a class, variable, method or constructor.
    Some examples are:
    Static -
        The static members of the class can be accessed without creating an object of a class. Don't need to instantiate a new object(Dont need to do new Object()). 
    Final - 
        This modifier tells the compiler not to change the value of a variable once assigned. If applied to class, it cannot be sub-classed. If applied to a method, the method cannot be overridden in sub-class.
    Abstract -
        There are situations in which you will want to define a superclass that declares the structure of a given abstraction without providing a complete implementation of every method. This modifier is applicable to class and methods only.
    Synchronized - 
    Volatile - 


Java Identifiers - 
    The names of variables, methods, classes, packages and interfaces. Variable names can include any alphabetic character or digit and the underscore _. ... The main restriction on the names you can give your variables is that they cannot contain any white space.

Java keywords - 
    Reserved words that cannot be used as variables, methods, classes, or any other identifiers. 

Java Packages -
    can be thought of as file directories where Java classes are organized, categorized, control access to your classes.
