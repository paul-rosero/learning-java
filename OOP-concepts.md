Best practices for OOP Concepts in Java. 

a) DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). You should never have two blocks of identical code in two different places. 
b) If you expect your JAva code to change in the future, encapsulate it by making all variables and methods private at the outset. 
c) Single Responsibility Principle. A class should always have only one functionality.
d) Open Closed Design. Make all methods and classes Closed for modifications but Open for an extension. That way, tried and tested code can remain static but can be modified to perform new tasks as needed.
