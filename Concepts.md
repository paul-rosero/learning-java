Java is a computer programming language that enforces an Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) model.

The 4 Pillars of Java OOP are A-P-I-E. Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation. 
    Abstraction - 
        it means using simple things to represent complexity. In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects, classes, and variables, represent more complex underlying code and data. It lets programmers create useful and reusable tools.  
    
    Polymorphism - 
        This Java OOP concepts lets programmers use the same word to mean different things in different contexts. Method overriding and overloading are examples of polymorphism. 
        Method Overriding -
            the child class can use the OOP polymorphism concept to override a method of its parent class.
        Method Overloading -
            a single method may perform different functions depending on the context in which it's called. 
    
    Inheritance -
        It lets programmers create new classes that share some of the attributes of existing classes. It works by letting a new class adopt the properties of another. We call the inheriting class a "subclass" or "child class". The original class is called the "parent class". We use the keyword "extends" to define a new class that inherits properties from an old class.
